The purpose of this analysis was to look at NYC CitiBike data and infer from it whether the CitiBike program would be viable to launch in Des Moines, Iowa. However, not once did we look at any type of data in Des Moines that would draw comparison to NYC. If we were truly checking for whether or no CitiBikes would be profitable in Des Moines we should have looked at tourist data for Des Moines, and researched the bike-abiliity of Des Moines also. NYC is notoroious for being very difficult to get around in by car wich creates the demand for a bike sharing service. Since no research was done to evaluate the demand for bike sharing in Des Moines, this data is only useful as analysis of CitiBike data in NYC.
